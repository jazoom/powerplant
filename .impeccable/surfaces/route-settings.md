# Settings

## Scope

The primary target is `route:/settings`. The visitor mode is Operate.

## Job

A local developer chooses the colour theme for Power Plant. The selected theme applies immediately and persists on the local machine.

The same page offers a confirmed local data reset. Reset records a request. The next start removes owned local data before stores open.

## Content and constraints

Theme is the first setting. The selector offers five colour themes. Springfield is the default.

Springfield, Evergreen Terrace, Leftorium, Stonecutters and Sector 7-G form one Springfield-inspired collection.

Local data is a separate danger section. Reset removes providers, projects, agents, environments, workflows, runs, artefacts and preferences.

Project source directories outside the Power Plant data directory remain unchanged.

The destructive action requires the checkbox labelled "I understand that this deletes all local Power Plant data." The command label is "Reset local data".

A successful command replaces the main page with "Stop and restart Power Plant to finish the reset." The next start removes local data before normal store initialisation.

The command does not stop the process. The browser does not submit a deletion path.

The page inherits the repository case-file shell. It uses a canonical GET route with document and Hypergraft navigation representations. Reset is a patch-only POST command.

## Memorable moment

The full desk changes colour while the selector stays in place.

The reset status page gives one instruction: stop and restart Power Plant.

## Unresolved decisions

None.
